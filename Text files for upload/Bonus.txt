Recommendation by Movie Actor:

We added a recommendation query which recommends movies by actor. This is done by using the Ranking property in movie_actors, and selecting TOP 1 record to find the lead actor/actress.


Exact match and string pattern matching searches:
If we click the exact match button, the query tries to get an exact match on movie title, director, etc.

Added a limiting control to all queries (maximum number of records returned)
